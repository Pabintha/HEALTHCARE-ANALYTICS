# ChestXRay Image Classification

This project aims to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: normal, viral pneumonia, and COVID-19, using the ResNet-18 model in PyTorch.

## Dataset Details

The dataset used for this project is the "COVID-19 Radiography Database." It consists of X-ray images categorized into the following classes:

1. **Normal:** X-ray images showing normal, healthy lungs.
2. **Viral Pneumonia:** X-ray images indicating lung infection due to viral pneumonia.
3. **COVID-19:** X-ray images showing lung infection specifically caused by COVID-19.

The dataset is organized as follows:

- `NORMAL` directory: Contains X-ray images of normal, healthy lungs.
- `Viral Pneumonia` directory: Contains X-ray images of lungs infected with viral pneumonia.
- `COVID-19` directory: Contains X-ray images of lungs infected with COVID-19.
